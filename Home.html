          I am thrilled to be starting fresh with new goals and a new career
          path. I've spent many years bartending, and had a great ride at Rocket
          Mortgage from 2019-2022. I'm here to break into tech to utilize my
          creativity and have endless growth potential and paths to take.

        <p class="col-6 offset-3">
          My current developer goals are to finish my current C#/.NET bootcamp
          successfully, and then pursue further skillsets/languages, whether
          that be with a future employer or self-studies. I chose C# for its
          powerful capabilities as well as its versatility. I have family in the
          industry who work in client-facing, project management roles, and
          back-end developement. They were a huge part of the push to get me to
          pull the trigger and start on my own path. My uncle told me about
          Python about 5 years ago and said "if you ever want to talk to me
          about this, I am all ears." After that, it had been a lingering
          thought in my mind, but self-doubt crept on me for so long that I just
          hadn't STARTED. Once I started, when the science field called me back
          where I belong after 3 years in finance, I went all in.

          I grew up in Michigan, born and raised. There isn't much exciting to
          say about my actual hometown in Mid-Michigan, but I currently live in
          Metro Detroit with other small roots in St. Helen, MI and Sarasota,
          FL. My goal is to be able to work remotely, and live in a few cities
          before I find my forever home. The ocean is what calls me the most, so
          I'm positive I'll end up near the water somewhere in the US.
