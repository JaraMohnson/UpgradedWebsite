           I am an animal lover, fitness nut, and spend most of my money traveling the world. 
           I am mostly vegetarian with goals of opening up an animal sanctuary some day. I 
           want some rescue cows, goats, a big happy pig, and some barn cats to keep everyone in check. 
           Fitness not only keeps my days on track, but it's a sense of familiarity and confidence for me. 
           No matter what I may be pursuing career-wise, I know that the second I step into the gym, I know exactly 
           what to do and where to go. I can look at advanved programming and see the design patterns. I'm many years into 
           this journey, and it is the best reminder that good things simply take time, and the success with any new career 
           will follow with patience.

           While I don't regret a second that I spent in my previous jobs, I did feel my creativity fading away. 
           I was in a position that didn't allow for experimentation since I had to follow government guidelines. 
           Without having a major outlet to use my creativity that I've always had, I just felt myself slipping further 
           away from trying to use it. (Let's be honest - I can't draw or paint, and I'm not going to learn how to 
           craft.) Being able to write my own code, display things how I see fit, experiment with different designs and 
           patterns has been a blessing and I can feel myself coming "back to life"!
